# Now Teensy can be used for penetration 
Teensy is like a rubber ducky, why did i choose teensy? because the price is very cheap for me. it is extremely useful for executing scripts on a target machine without the need for human-to-keyboard interaction ( HID-ATTACK ). When you insert the device, it will be detected as a keyboard, and it will be using the microprocessor and onboard flash memory storage, you can send a very fast set of keystrokes to the target’s machine and completely compromise it, regardless of autorun. I’ve used it in my security testing to run recon or enumeration scripts, execute reverse shells, exploit local DLL hijack/privilege escalation vulnerabilities, and get all passwords. 
Now i'm developing new tools, the name of it is Brutal 

# Brutal

Brutal is a toolkit to quickly create various payload, powershell and virus attacks and launch listeners for a Human Interface Device.

## Video 

- Check this video out https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaqY-pQpuV0

- Do you want a scene like mr robot hacking scene when Angela moss plugs a usb into a computer to get credential information? there is a payload in Brutal (optional 3 or 4).

## The Goal 

- Generate various payload and powershell attacks without coding 

- To help breaking computers very fast and agile :p

- The Payloads Compatibility > target Windows machines only


## Requirements

- Arduino Software ( I used v1.6.7 )

- TeensyDuino 

- Linux udev rules 

- How to install all the requirements? [Visit This Wiki](https://github.com/Screetsec/Brutal/wiki/Install-Requirements)

## Supported Hardware

The following hardware has been tested and is known to work.

- Teensy 3.x 

- Usb Cable
